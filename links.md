# Top links that i find helpful for Operating Sytem subject
## Week 1
1. [Operating System](https://edu.gcfglobal.org/en/computerbasics/understanding-applications/1/)<br>
I wanted to know what is exactly is operating system and why we have to learn it. From what i gather, operating system is a software that runs on computer and manages the computer's memory and processes, as well as all of its software and hardware and the reason why we have to learn it is so we can have better understanding on our software (because operating system basically runs our laptop) and gain deep understanding of the system (and for some increase our value as a programmer).
3. [Scripting](https://www.howtogeek.com/67469/the-beginners-guide-to-shell-scripting-the-basics/)<br>
This article contains beginner guide to shell scripting. It explains the definition of shell scripting, what i have to prepare, and the scripting guidelines itself. It's really interesting because the explanation is so thorough and beginner friendly.
2. [VirtualBox](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/v/virtualbox.htm)
For Week 1 assignments, we were required to install virtualbox. However, at first, i was confused why we have to download it and i'm still quite unclear what is exactly virtualbox, but after reading this article i have a clear understanding on virtualbox.
4. [What is AWK?](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/awk-command-unixlinux-examples/)<br>
What i learn from this link is Awk is a scripting language used for manipulating data and generating reports and the awk command programming language requires no compiling and allows the user to use variables, numeric functions, string functions, and logical operators. Since we started to learn scripting in Week 1, this article definitely helps me a lot.
5. [Regex tutorial for Linux](https://likegeeks.com/regex-tutorial-linux/)<br>
Since we began scripting, the term regex is commonly heard of. From this article i can learn what is regex and from what i understand is that regex is a regular expression or in general, regex is a pattern of text you define that a Linux program like sed or awk uses it to filter text. I still have to understand regex a bit more but this article really helps.

## Week 2
6. [Introduction to Cyber Security](https://geekflare.com/understanding-cybersecurity/)<br>
This week, we were introduced to cyber security. I thought cyber security is a fascinating subject by watching the introduction video required in W02 slide but i want to understand a bit more about cyber security. This link helps me understand cyber security better and it's very useful for beginner.
7. [C Language basic](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-language-set-1-introduction/)<br>
C language is one of the demo that we tried this week. Before trying the demo, i wanted to know what C language is and how it is different from any other programming language that i've tried, like Java and Python. By reading this article, i can learn that turns out C language is just as fun as Java and Python!

## Week 3
7. [File system](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_file_system.htm)<br>
One of the topic that we have to learn this week is file system. Based on this article, a file is a named collection of related information that is recorded on secondary storage such as magnetic disks, magnetic tapes and optical disks. In general, a file is a sequence of bits, bytes, lines or records whose meaning is defined by the files creator and user. I also learn that a file Structure should be according to a required format that the operating system can understand.
8. [File system interface](https://www.w3schools.in/operating-system-tutorial/file-system-interface/)<br>
Similiar to the previous number, this article also talks about file system interface. From this article, i can learn about file operations, like creating a file, writing a file, reading a file, etc, which are fundamental for this subject.
9. [Device directory](https://study.com/academy/lesson/the-dev-directory-in-the-linux-filesystem.html)<br>
In order to understand our directory better, we have to know where our directory is located. In Linux, the /dev directory contains device and other special files. Even though you have to make an account to open this article, it's worth it because it gives clear explanation for /dev directory.
