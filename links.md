# Top links that i find helpful for Operating Sytem subject
1. [Operating System](https://edu.gcfglobal.org/en/computerbasics/understanding-applications/1/)<br>
I wanted to know what is exactly is operating system and why we have to learn it. From what i gather, operating system is a software that runs on computer and manages the computer's memory and processes, as well as all of its software and hardware and the reason why we have to learn it is so we can have better understanding on our software (because operating system basically runs our laptop) and gain deep understanding of the system (and for some increase our value as a programmer).
3. [Scripting](https://www.howtogeek.com/67469/the-beginners-guide-to-shell-scripting-the-basics/)<br>
This article contains beginner guide to shell scripting. It explains the definition of shell scripting, what i have to prepare, and the scripting guidelines itself. It's really interesting because the explanation is so thorough and beginner friendly.
2. [VirtualBox](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/v/virtualbox.htm)
For Week 1 assignments, we were required to install virtualbox. However, at first, i was confused why we have to download it and i'm still quite unclear what is exactly virtualbox, but after reading this article i have a clear understanding on virtualbox.
4. [What is AWK?](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/awk-command-unixlinux-examples/)<br>
What i learn from this link is Awk is a scripting language used for manipulating data and generating reports and the awk command programming language requires no compiling and allows the user to use variables, numeric functions, string functions, and logical operators. Since we started to learn scripting in Week 1, this article definitely helps me a lot.
5. [Regex tutorial for Linux](https://likegeeks.com/regex-tutorial-linux/)<br>
Since we began scripting, the term regex is commonly heard of. From this article i can learn what is regex and from what i understand is that regex is a regular expression or in general, regex is a pattern of text you define that a Linux program like sed or awk uses it to filter text. I still have to understand regex a bit more but this article really helps.
